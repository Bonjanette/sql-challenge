Module 9 Challenge CWRU Bootcamp

The ERD is located in EmployeeSQL/sql-challenge-employee-ERD . It was created using the QuickDatabaseDiagrams.com tool referenced in the Challenge instructions. https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/#/d/jgXmQf

The table schemata is located in EmployeeSQL/sql-challenge-employee-table-schema.

The queries are located in EmployeeSQL/sql-challenge-employee-Queries.

I created a python function to check whether columns contained unique values and stored the function in a Jupyter Notebook located in EmployeeSQL/data/Check_column_contains_unique_vals.
